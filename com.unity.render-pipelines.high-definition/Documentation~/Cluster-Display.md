# Cluster Display

The High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) supports Cluster Display, that is, distributed rendering. Cluster Display features are provided by the following packages:
* TODO: Cluster Sync Package
* [com.unity.cluster-display.graphics](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.cluster-display.graphics): provides graphics features such as projection slicing and overscan, built on top of HDRP's Cluster Display support.

Please refer to [com.unity.cluster-display.graphics documentation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.cluster-display.graphics/blob/master/Documentation%7E/index.md) for more information regarding cluster rendering features.
